Hello Jing, 

I hope you are having a wonderful day! You've put considerable thought and expertise into your content.

Speaking of insightful content, I'm with knowyourdna.com. We recently discovered an intriguing topic: "Is Parkinson's Genetic?" What's fascinating is that despite popular belief, only a small percentage of Parkinson's cases are hereditary. You can check our findings here: https://knowyourdna.com/parkinsons-genetic/.

Below are essential insights from our guide tailored to benefit jinghuazhao.github.io 's audience:

    Comprehensive Understanding: Our guide delves deep into Parkinson's, from basics like 'What is Parkinson's?' to more nuanced details such as the genetic links and types.
    Empowering Knowledge: With insights on early warning signs and symptoms, readers can be more proactive about their health and awareness.
    Informed Decision Making: Sections like 'Can You Avoid Parkinson's?' and 'Can I Diagnose Parkinson's Early?' offer valuable information for potential preventative measures and early interventions.
    Future Insight: Our coverage on understanding carriers and the potential genetic implications for offspring adds depth and foresight to the topic.


Would you consider including a link to our guide? It would be useful for your readers.

And if you have any questions, just let me know.

Hello Jing,

I hope all is well. We've all heard the common phrase: "Drink in
moderation." it turns out that this phrase may be more important than we
thought. Recent studies have shown that no level of alcohol consumption
is safe for our health and can cause cancer. Alcohol is a level-one
carcinogen, right up with tobacco and asbestos, which means it is a
substance that causes cancer.

That's why we recently updated our guide to the potential effects of
alcohol, focusing on the link between alcohol and cancer. Here is our
guide:https://alcoholrehabhelp.org/addiction/effects/cancer/
<https://alcoholrehabhelp.org/addiction/effects/cancer/>.

We include the following:

  *
    An overview of the link between alcohol and cancer.
  *
    The types of cancer that can be caused by alcohol consumption.
  *
    How drinking alcohol affects the body.


I believe your readers would benefit from our article. Would you help us
help your readers by adding a link to our guide on your site?

You can add it here:https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.html
<https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.html>.

I think your readers would benefit from our resource, and I would be
happy to answer any questions you have about it.

*Subject:* Loved The Compilation Of Your Resources

Hello Leslie,

I'm Karen Hadley, and I hope you're well. I also hope you remember me;
we got in touch in the year 2022 about our website wallstreetmojo, and I
was delighted that you included our link into your site:
https://jhz22.user.srcf.net/mrclinks.htm
<https://jhz22.user.srcf.net/mrclinks.htm>, thank you.

I was also wondering if you were still updating that resource page. I'd
also like to recommend another excellent free resource which is totally
focused on Excel.

You can review our resources below:

  * ExcelMojo <https://www.excelmojo.com/excel/>: Learn and Master
    Microsoft Excel with 200+ free articles, step by step guides, all
    about formulas & functions, self-study resources and excel templates.

I hope this will make a great addition to your resource page, just
something extra for your students.

Either way, keep up the great work!

Thanks for taking the time to read this email. Above all, hope you're
keeping safe?

And If sent to the wrong contact, kindly redirect to the correct contact.

Hello Jing Hua,

I hope you have been well and safe this past week! I just wanted to get back in touch with you and see if you had any thoughts about what I outlined in my last email and if perhaps you had the chance to consider posting our link to your page https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.html?

Here it is again in case you missed it -- Mesothelioma Cancer.

We would be so grateful for the opportunity to provide a space for support and to educate your visitors about this disease! I hope to hear back again and wish you a lovely day.

Good morning,

I hope you're having a nice week and this email finds you in good health. My name is Jessica Fisher and I'm reaching out to you today because I noticed you provide some useful health resources on https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.html and I was hoping you would be interested in an additional resource for jinghuazhao.github.io? 

I'd like to discuss this more in depth at your convenience. You can always reach me at this same email. And if for some reason we don't connect today, would it be okay to try again next week?

I appreciate your time in advance, and look forward to hearing from you.

Jessica

Hello,

Forgive the extra email, I just wanted to see if you got my question below - any response would be greatly appreciated.  If you're not the right 
contact, it would be fantastic if you could point me in the right direction or pass my message along.

Thanks so much,

Sarah

Hello,

I found that you are providing some health information on your page https://jinghuazhao.github.io/mrclinks.htm - including sites like the National 
Cancer Institute - and I wanted to suggest an addition.

My current project is creating more awareness and better prevention of a serious health issue that is underserved in healthcare and education.

There is truth in the common notion that dark skinned individuals are more resistant to skin cancer (1 in 10 cases are black people), there is danger in 
ignoring the issue completely.

With a 34% death rate, black people are 3 times more likely than white people to die from melanoma within 5 years of diagnosis. These severe cases are 
due mostly to a lack in early detection.

This is due in part to an absence in education of the danger and signs in both schools and among healthcare professionals. Most doctors are taught the 
signs on white skin, which are different in appearance and location.

Because of that, I was wondering if you could add this to your site, which I've found to be the best consolidated resource on the matter – 
well-researched and accessible: https://thedermreview.com/skin-cancer-awareness-prevention-for-people-of-color/

It would mean a lot to me if you could let me know if you can add it, or what you think. If you prefer that I do not contact you, just let me know.

Thanks so much for your time and attention - I look forward to hearing back.

Warm regards,
