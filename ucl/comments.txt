Hi Jing,

Hope all is well on your end. I'm checking in about your previous email:

Did you still have plans of adding our guide to your page?

For reference our guide on credible sources – What Are Credible Sources? – to your collection of links: https://jinghuazhao.github.io/ucllinks.html

No worries if you haven't gotten around to it yet! 

Thanks again,

Hi Jing,

I’m Rob, reaching out about one of your pages.

See here: https://jinghuazhao.github.io/ucllinks.html

Are you the person in charge of updating your page?

We created a comprehensive guide to help students and researchers find the perfect sources of credible information.

Because it could people visiting your page, would you be open to adding it?

Let me know and I'll send it over! 

Thanks in advance,
