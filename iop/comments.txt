Re: SUMMARY: Software for generalized linear mixed models

Dear all,

This message can complete the summary that I posted yesterday about
softwares to fit generalized linear mixed models.

just a small correction:

gllamm6 is out-of-date. The current version is gllamm which
is available, together with documentation, at

http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/IoP/Departments/BioComp/programs/gllamm.html

By the way, gllamm uses adaptive quadrature - as far as I know
the only implementation for multilevel models (more than 2 levels).

gllamm can fit a wide range of latent variable models, generalized
linear mixed models being a special case.

Hi,

I came across your page, http://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/Personal/jinghua.zhao/kcllinks.htm while looking for some 
information on metabolism for a nutrition class.  You have some great resources that were really helpful in my research 
and I wanted to let you know about one that doesn't seem to be working properly, 
http://www.wbsaunders.com/catalog/wbs-prod.pl?0026-0495.  This page, 
http://www.themedifastplan.com/feature-articles/the-metabolism-resource-page/ has some great information and resources 
on metabolism that I think would make a nice addition to your page if you are interested.  Again, thanks for the 
helpful resources.

Thanks,

Andrea Higgins

Hi!

My name is Lisa Perez and I wanted to provide feedback on your page 
(http://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/Personal/jinghua.zhao/kcllinks.htm). I'm not sure if you're the right person to contact, but I wanted 
to tell you that since I have been working on updating our online resources at the library, your page was a great source of 
information.

As a thank you, I thought I would pass along this additional resource I have been using as well in case you were looking to add more 
to your page. I have been using material from this page (http://www.barcodesinc.com/articles/all-about-algorithms.htm) . It has a ton 
of information on algorithms that you may find useful!


Thanks Again :)

hello and Happy Wednesday!
Just wanted to thank you and let you know I've been using your page 
(http://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/Personal/jinghua.zhao/kcllinks.htm) for some research for a 
programming class.

As a thank you for your helpful site here is another "The Development and Use of Computer 
Algorithms"  
(http://www.cbtplanet.com/articles-tutorials/the-development-and-use-of-computer-algorithms.htm . 
) that you can add to your page.  I loved the real world examples of algorithms in the stock 
market for instance.   Hope you find it as useful as I did.

Subject: Public Health and Climate Change Resource Inquiry

Hi Jing,

The URL didn't go through for some reason last time and I wanted to make sure you got my email.

I am curious if you are the administrator for this site: mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/Personal/jinghua.zhao/ucllinks.htm

I recently completed a project aimed at illuminating the implications of climate change on public health. Not only does the resource 
provide examples of how this is happening, it also directs readers to several organizations which are striving to find solutions for 
these problems.

I would love to share this resource with those who might find it useful and am curious if you are the correct person to contact about 
such a request?

Thank you!

Best,

Charlotte

Hi Jing Hua Zhao,

I came across your website and wanted to notify you about a broken link on your page in case you weren't aware of it. The link on 
mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/Personal/jinghua.zhao/kcllinks.htm which links to http://www.nejm.org/content/index.asp is no longer working. I've 
included a link to a useful page on Medicine Resources that you could replace the broken link with if you're interested in updating 
your website. Thanks for providing a great resource!

Hello there

It's my hope you're having a wonderful day!

I saw you shared the American College of Physicians(https://www.acponline.org/) on this page of your website(https://jinghuazhao.github.io/kcllinks.html) and so I thought you'd be interested with our latest guide which I think might be of interest to you and your readers.

Here's the link - https://www.collaboratemd.com/blog/medical-practice-revenue/

It is a free resource guide on increasing your medical practice revenue. This guide features different ways of improving revenue for your medical practice which includes improved scheduling and collecting difficult patient payments to name a few.

Hope you find the resource useful! And perhaps you could share it with your audience by including it on your website?

I believe it will complement other resources on the page and would be an excellent additional resource.

Thanking you in advance for your time and consideration.
